# Local Application Platform Runbook

## Purpose

Run and verify the dormant Phase 2 Rails and React platform without production credentials or cloud services.

## Prerequisites

- Docker with Compose v2
- Bun 1.3.13 for the existing application and replacement web checks
- Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit installed through Playwright when running browser tests

Ruby is intentionally not required on the host. Rails uses the pinned container toolchain under `tooling/rails` and the application image under `apps/platform-api`.

## Start dependencies

```bash
docker compose up --detach --wait postgres redis
```

PostgreSQL listens on `127.0.0.1:15432`; Redis listens on `127.0.0.1:16379`. Both use disposable local credentials defined in `compose.yaml`.

## Start the replacement applications

Export a local Supabase URL, anonymous key, expected JWT issuer, and disposable local JWT secret. These values are passed only to the services that need them; the anonymous browser key is public, while the JWT secret remains server-side. An HTTPS JWKS endpoint can instead be supplied through a reviewed Compose override.

```bash
export VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
export VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=replace-with-local-anon-key
export SUPABASE_JWT_ISSUER=http://127.0.0.1:54321/auth/v1
export SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=replace-with-disposable-local-jwt-secret
```

Do not use a production token, signing secret, or provider credential for local verification.

```bash
docker compose --profile application up --build
```

Rails is exposed at `http://127.0.0.1:13000` and the Vite preview at `http://127.0.0.1:14173`. Health and readiness endpoints must succeed before exercising product routes.

The application profile is dormant infrastructure. Starting it does not redirect the current Next.js application or change Vercel, Supabase, provider, or AWS configuration.

## Verify

Run the Phase 2 verification entry point from the repository root:

```bash
bash scripts/verify-phase2.sh
```

The verifier checks contracts, Rails against real PostgreSQL and Redis, the replacement web application, and the unchanged root application. It uses no live financial provider or model credentials.

## Stop

```bash
docker compose --profile application down
```

This retains local PostgreSQL and Redis volumes. To discard only this Compose projects disposable data after confirming no needed local state remains:

```bash
docker compose --profile application down --volumes
```

Never point these cleanup commands at another Compose project or a shared database.

## Troubleshooting

- If a bound port is unavailable, stop the conflicting local process; do not expose the service on all interfaces.
- If Rails reports a schema mismatch, run its versioned migration command rather than editing the database manually.
- If generated API types are stale, rerun the committed contract generator and review both the contract and generated diff.
- If provider fixtures fail, update them only with a reviewed contract change; deterministic CI must not fall back to a live request.
