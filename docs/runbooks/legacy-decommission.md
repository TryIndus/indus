# Legacy decommission

Start only after seven stable days at full replacement traffic, a 30-day
rollback window, zero reconciliation drift, successful restore rehearsal, and
written product/security/platform approval.

Export and verify final Supabase data/identity backups, Vercel configuration,
DNS history, audit evidence, and provider ownership. Disable legacy writes,
observe another seven days, then revoke legacy credentials and integrations.
Remove DNS targets before deleting runtimes. Delete Vercel/Supabase resources
only from an explicit inventory with two-person confirmation; retain backups
and legal/audit artifacts per policy. Remove compatibility code and redundant
copies in a separate reviewed change. Record each removed resource and its
recovery status.
