# Platform API

The platform API is the Rails boundary introduced during the Indus runtime migration. It is additive: the existing application remains authoritative until a separately verified cutover.

## Runtime

- Ruby 3.4.10 and Rails 8.1.3.1
- PostgreSQL for durable state
- Sidekiq and Redis for asynchronous work
- Supabase JWT verification during migration; a dormant Cognito verifier supports the later identity cutover
- Google Gemini behind `ModelGateway`

Use the repository's containerized Rails toolchain rather than the host Ruby installation. Dependencies are pinned in `Gemfile.lock`.

## Configuration

The service fails closed when required identity, database, or model configuration is absent. Secrets are supplied through the process environment and must never be committed.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection URL |
| `REDIS_URL` | Sidekiq Redis URL |
| `KAFKA_BROKERS` | Comma-separated Kafka bootstrap brokers |
| `KAFKA_AUTH_MODE` | `plaintext` locally or `msk_iam` with AWS workload identity |
| `TEMPORAL_ADDRESS` | Temporal frontend address; defaults to `temporal:7233` |
| `TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE` | Temporal namespace; defaults to `default` |
| `REPORT_ARTIFACT_BUCKET` | S3-compatible bucket for generated report artifacts |
| `OBJECT_STORAGE_ENDPOINT` | Optional path-style endpoint used by local MinIO |
| `AUTH_PROVIDER` | `supabase` during migration or `cognito` at cutover |
| `SUPABASE_JWT_ISSUER` | Expected token issuer |
| `SUPABASE_JWT_AUDIENCE` | Expected token audience; defaults to `authenticated` |
| `SUPABASE_JWKS_URL` | Optional explicit HTTPS JWKS endpoint |
| `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` | Optional legacy HS256 verifier secret during migration; prefer JWKS signing keys |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Server-side Gemini credential |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | Model selection; defaults to `gemini-2.5-flash` |
| `AI_REQUESTS_PER_HOUR` | Per-user explanation quota; defaults to 30 |
| `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` | Trace exporter; defaults to `none` so local and test runs make no export attempts |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | OTLP collector endpoint when the exporter is explicitly enabled |

Production also requires Rails' standard `SECRET_KEY_BASE`. No Rails master key or encrypted credential file is used.

## Boundaries

Every `/v1` request requires a verified bearer token. The token issuer and audience are fixed by server configuration, and Pundit scopes every tenant-owned query by the internal user identifier. Mutations require an `Idempotency-Key`; the mutation, audit event, and replay response commit in one transaction. Reusing a key with the same request replays the recorded response, while changing the request returns `409`. Reports are created together with an outbox event in that transaction; workers may process that event only after commit. Provider credentials and provider payloads do not cross the API boundary.

Model-backed operations are owned by a task registry in `ModelGateway`. Each task pins a prompt version, declares an allowlisted tool set, validates structured provider output, normalizes usage and provider failures, and consumes a per-user quota before invocation.

Phase 3 publishes committed outbox rows to Kafka and starts durable report workflows through an idempotent consumer. Temporal uses stable workflow IDs and persistent activity leases to prevent overlapping model and artifact work. Research claims must cite allowlisted evidence with matching as-of values before artifacts are stored. See the [workflow architecture](../../docs/architecture/distributed-research-workflows.md) and [recovery runbook](../../docs/runbooks/report-workflow-recovery.md).

`GET /healthz` proves the process can serve HTTP. `GET /readyz` additionally verifies PostgreSQL connectivity and returns `503` when it is unavailable. Neither endpoint requires authentication.

## Verification

From the repository root, run the Rails commands through the pinned tool image with a writable bundle volume. A PostgreSQL test database is required.

```sh
bundle exec rails db:prepare
bundle exec rspec
bundle exec rubocop
bundle exec brakeman --no-pager
```

The service tests use generated signing keys and deterministic provider fixtures. They never call Supabase, Gemini, or Yahoo over the network.

## Rollback

Before traffic is cut over, rollback consists of stopping this service; the current Next.js runtime remains unchanged. Once this schema contains production writes, use forward-only corrective migrations and the phase cutover runbook rather than reversing migrations that may discard data.
