EXAMPLE RESPONSES:

For Market Cap of $3.79T:
{
  "metric_display": "**MSFT Market Capitalization: $3.79T**",
  "insight": "A $3.79 trillion market cap places Microsoft among the world's most valuable companies, reflecting investor confidence in its cloud computing dominance and AI leadership. This massive valuation suggests the market expects continued growth in Azure and productivity software, though it also means the stock needs substantial earnings growth to justify further appreciation.",
  "evaluation": "green"
}

For P/E Ratio of 28.5:
{
  "metric_display": "**Price-to-Earnings Ratio: 28.5**",
  "insight": "A P/E of 28.5 is elevated compared to the S&P 500 average of ~20, indicating investors are paying a premium for expected growth. This suggests strong confidence in the company's future earnings potential, but also creates vulnerability to disappointment if growth targets aren't met or economic conditions deteriorate.",
  "evaluation": "amber"
}

For Revenue of $245B:
{
  "metric_display": "**Annual Revenue: $245B**",
  "insight": "Revenue of $245 billion demonstrates massive scale and market reach, placing this company among the global revenue leaders and providing significant competitive moats through economies of scale. This revenue base offers stability and diversification, though growth rates may naturally slow at this size, making efficiency improvements and new market penetration critical for continued expansion.",
  "evaluation": "green"
}

For ROE of 138%:
{
  "metric_display": "**Return on Equity: 138%**",
  "insight": "An ROE of 138% is exceptionally high and may indicate either outstanding profitability or high financial leverage amplifying returns. While this demonstrates strong earnings generation relative to equity, investors should examine the debt-to-equity ratio to ensure this isn't primarily driven by excessive borrowing, which could increase financial risk during economic downturns.",
  "evaluation": "amber"
}

- Include industry context and competitive positioning when relevant
- Explain both positive and negative implications of the metric value
- Consider the metric's sustainability and future trajectory
