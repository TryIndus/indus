https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82d2c5de-a971-4c8b-8481-fa68fcffc9e4

Indus is an intelligent financial analysis platform that provides comprehensive stock market data, real-time charts, and AI-powered insights to help investors make informed decisions. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, SSE, Alpaca API, Yahoo Finance, Google Gemini, and TradingView.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) v1.0 or later
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project (free tier works)
- An [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/) account (paper trading is fine)
- A [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) API key (for Gemini)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vicdenz/indus.git
cd indus
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Copy the example env file and fill in your keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your credentials:

| Variable | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase dashboard > Project Settings > API |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase dashboard > Project Settings > API |
| `ALPACA_API_KEY` | Alpaca dashboard > Paper Trading > API Keys |
| `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY` | Alpaca dashboard > Paper Trading > API Keys |
| `ALPACA_IS_PAPER` | Set to `true` for paper trading (recommended) |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google AI Studio > Get API key |

### 4. Set up the database

Database schema, constraints, grants, row-level security policies, and AI quotas are versioned in `supabase/migrations/`. Apply the migrations in order through the Supabase CLI or your normal database migration process. Do not recreate tables from copied SQL snippets.

For a disposable local database:

```bash
bun run db:start
bun run db:reset
```

### 5. Run the development server

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
